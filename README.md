Arvind Narayanan is an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton. He leads the Princeton Web Transparency and Accountability Project to uncover how companies collect and use our personal information. Narayanan also leads a research team investigating the security, anonymity, and stability of cryptocurrencies, as well as novel applications of blockchains. He co-created a massive open online course, and a textbook on bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies. His doctoral research showed the fundamental limits of de-identification, for which he received the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Award. Narayanan is an affiliated faculty member at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton and an affiliate scholar at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society.

Jeremy Clark is an assistant professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo, where his gold medal dissertation was on designing and deploying secure voting systems, including Scantegrity—the first cryptographically verifiable system used in a public-sector election. He wrote one of the earliest academic papers on bitcoin, completed several research projects in the area, and contributed to the first textbook. Beyond research, he has worked with several municipalities on voting technology and testified to the Canadian Senate on bitcoin. You can follow him on Twitter at @PulpSpy.
